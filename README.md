How to work on Imbalanced Data

Prediction and Model selection

This notebook uses the Red Wine Quality Dataset and the Dataset csv file is attached in the same folder.

The Problem statement is, client need to generalise the quality of the wine into three classes either 'bad' or 'normal or 'good'.
To do this we need to convert the quality into three classes. After this conversion, the data has changed to imbalanced data.

For a balanced data, evaluating the model with accuracy score is a good choice. Because, the accuaracy score will give equal weightage to all the classes.

But for a Imbalanced classes, considering only the Accuracy score is not a right approach, Precision and recall needs to be considered.

Lets begin!
